screenshots from a Zabbix server that extracts SystemStatus every 10s and the subitems (calculated items) extract informations like expiration date , currently active calls , .... via regex
- one screenshot shows the calculated items that parse SystemStatus
- the other one shows a 10s refresh rate of currently active calls 

Once again, the possibilities are limitless. We have a trigger (e-mail alert) when active calls reaches 16 (the license limit)
